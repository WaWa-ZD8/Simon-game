# Simon-game

This is a simple implementation of the Simon Game built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. The game challenges players to remember and reproduce an ever-growing sequence of colors.

How to Play
Start the Game: Press any key to begin the game.
Memorize the Sequence: The game will highlight a color in a sequence and play a corresponding sound. The sequence will grow with each level.
Repeat the Sequence: Click the buttons in the exact order as shown by the game.
Progress to Next Level: Successfully completing the sequence progresses you to the next level, where an additional color is added to the sequence.
Game Over: If you click the wrong color, the game will display a "Game Over" message, play a sound, and allow you to restart.

Features
Four interactive buttons (red, blue, green, yellow) with sounds and animations.
Incremental level progression with an increasing sequence.
Feedback for correct and incorrect user actions.
Restart functionality after a game over.
